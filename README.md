# Agentic MCP Server

This README provides information about creating and using agentic MCP servers. Agentic MCP servers are designed to enable more complex interactions and workflows by allowing the server to act more autonomously, making decisions and taking actions based on the context and available tools.

## What is an Agentic MCP Server?

An agentic MCP server is an extension of the standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. While regular MCP servers primarily provide resources and tools, agentic servers can also incorporate logic to make decisions, manage state, and interact with external systems more dynamically. This allows for more sophisticated use cases, such as automated workflows, intelligent data processing, and adaptive system behavior.

Key characteristics of agentic MCP servers include:

- **Decision-Making Logic:** Ability to make decisions based on context and available information.
- **State Management:** Maintain and update internal state to track progress and context.
- **Dynamic Interactions:** Interact with external systems and other MCP servers based on the current state and goals.
- **Autonomous Actions:** Take actions without explicit user commands, based on predefined rules or learned behavior.

## Development

To develop an agentic MCP server, you can use the MCP SDK. Here's a general guide:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Build the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **For development with auto-rebuild:**
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```

## Installation

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-server-name": {
      "command": "/path/to/your-server/build/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
